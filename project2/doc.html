    <h1>Amiibo Quiz Documentation</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>For my project 2, I ended up going with the Amiibo API and figuring out how I wanted to impliment quiz like
        behavior. This was my priority before I did anything else. I ended up having two dropdown menus for the user to
        select their guesses and a submit button to submit the response. I used the list of amiibos given to me by the
        API to create values to select from the dropdowns, ensuring there were no repeats.</p>
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicate-values-from-js-array">Source for how I sorted
        arrays. I used [new ... Set(array)]</a>
    <p>A random amiibo is selected upon clicking the start, submit, reset, or skip buttons are pressed. The start button loads in the data from the API] Different
        values on screen are updated depending on which button is pressed. If the values chosen
        by the user matches the current amiibo (character and series), they get it right and increase their score.
        Otherwise they lose a life. I've also given the user an option to disable the use of amiibo cards.</p>
    <h2>Requirements Met/Grading (Self Grading based on Rubric)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>API - Images of randomly chosen amiibo are selected for the user to guess - 10/10</li>
        <li>Local Storage - The highest score of the user is stored in local storage and displayed to the user if a high
            score exists when page is loaded. - 10/10</li>
        <li>Controls - Submit, Restart, and Skip buttons as well as drop down selection. There is also a checkbox to
            either include or exclude amiibo cards - 10/10</li>
        <li>Error Free - No errors occur when running on my end - 10/10</li>
        <li>Code - Stored externally, commented, and functions are used to reduce code - 4/4</li>
        <li>HTML - Validates fine - 4/4</li>
        <li>CSS - Validates fine - 4/4</li>
        <li>Visual Design - The visual looks fine on the eyes, but there are definitely some design aspects which are
            needed to make it a decent looking design (placement of elements, space usage, etc). The sizing of amiibo
            images are wonky, as the original images are all different sizes and I needed a concrete size to ensure the rest of the
            page looks fine/does not overlap with the image. - 5/8</li>
        <li>Interaction Design - I would say interactive elements are visually clear to the user and are clear about
            what they do. However, the dropdowns do present some accessibliity issues with having to scroll large lists.
            I was unfortunately unable to determine how to create a typable dropdown to search for values in time for
            submission without having to rework aspects of my project. - 6/8</li>
        <li>Responseive Design - Website looks fine at 1024 x 768 resolution - 8/8</li>
        <li>Checkpoint Deliverables - Both proposal and prototype were submitted on time - 8/8</li>
        <li>Documentation - This page exists - 6/6</li>
        <li>Score: 95/100</li>
        <p>I would give myself closer to an A- for this project as I don't really like how the final design of this
            project ended up looking as, there is a possible accessibiliy issue due to how long the the dropdowns are.

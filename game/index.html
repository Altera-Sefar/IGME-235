				<h2>Description</h2>

				<p><em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
				<br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually <strong>chase</strong> you around. 
				<br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

					This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," 
					<br>or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.

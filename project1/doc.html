        <h1>Phase 1</h1>
        <p>Link to original proposal: <a href = "media/proposal.png">Proposal</a></p>

        <p>For my plans for responsiveness in phase 2, I plan to have 2 or 3 breakpoints to transition my site from a 3 column layout to a 2 and 1 column layouts depending on viewport size. I currently plan to have the left most content stay at the top while the leftmost content will be moved to below the content before it. Images will be resized and the top banner will be smaller width while maintaining the same pattern. Images will be resized according to the viewport size dictated by the breakpoints.</p>
        <p>Below is an illustration which is meant to resemble what I explained above</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>I used the Tetris Grid lab as a reference/guide for my navigation system. <a href="https://github.com/rit-igm-web/igme-235-shared/blob/main/exercises/tetris-grid.md">Tetris Grid</a></p>
        
        <p>I used this website as a source as to how to incoorperate smooth scrolling from the nav bar. <a href = "https://gomakethings.com/smooth-scrolling-links-with-only-css/">Smooth Scrolling</a></p>
        
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of my website is to act as a portfolio for recruiters.</p>
        <p>For this reason, I wanted to ensure my name and who I am was very visible to the viewer on the top.</p>
        <p>Looking back, I should have most likely have put the About Me section above my projects, but it still works</p>
        <p>as my intended audience would be reading left to right, and thus reading About me and then my project afterwards.</p>
        <p>I also was sure to include links to each of the projects. I put them near the images of gameplay to signify that the</p>
        <p>links would bring the viewer to a link where they can play the game after downloading.</p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>I found this project an interesting experience. The most challenging part for me was making sure my breakpoints</p>
        <p>because oh boy mobile screens are a lot bigger than I thought they were. I also did come across issues with images</p>
        <p>and responiveness, particularly with sizing and position, but I feel as though I did an okay job. I did have to disable</p>
        <p>an image of me with potatoes at lower widths as it negatively affected spacing to the point where there would be empty space</p>
        <p>other areas of the page due to the way I sized rows.</p>

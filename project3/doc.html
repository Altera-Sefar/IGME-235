    <h1>Clyde's Revolution Documentation</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>I. Premise/Story</h2>
    <p>The premise of Clyde's Revolution is that the player must defend his square workforce union from the
        enemy tribe, Circles of the CEO</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>II. Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The gameplay of Clyde's Revolution is similar to a tower defense game where the player can place
        defensive structures for a cost in gold. Different structures have different functionality such as
        shooting fast with weak bullets or slowly with string bullets, etc. My thoughts were to give players
        options as to how they want to approach a battle. As enemy numbers rapidly increase as players
        progress through levels. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>III. Graphical Design</h2>
    <p>Graphically, I just did not have time to find or create assets for this project, so I reworked my theme into a
        battle
        between squares and circles. So, I did my best to utilized shapes and colors to mimick UI and other game
        details. If
        I were to have more time, I would try to add custom assets (maybe keep the shape theme and make custom assets)
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>IV. Processes</h2>
    <p>For this project, I approached mechanics/ideas one thing at a time. First I incoorperated building selection and
        a
        working grid on pixi. I was having issues with getting object on click events working, so I removed the grid and
        used text labels to spawn in buildings, but the players now have the ability to place buildings anywhere they
        would
        like. This was my biggest hurtle to get working, but after that, I would say implementing enemies, bullets,
        building
        costs/types, and updaing label were on the easier side of things.</p>
        <hr>
    <h2>Requirements Met - Final Code Submission</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Included at least 1 E6 Class: Multiple class implemented, but the important ones are AttackBuilding, Enemy,
            and Bullets Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Validation: HTML Validates Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Error Prevention: I restricted player input for what I expect in the gameplay loop. For some reason thought, upon loading the page, sometimes does not work. I don't know if this is a pixi problem or a me problem, but it goes away eventually by reloading the page Score: 5/10</li>
        <li>Optimized Images: Nothing looks bad or too big. Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Documentation: This website exists Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Proposal on Time: My proposal was on time Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Prototype Available for Critique: My prototype was available to critique and I gave out critiques too Score:
            20/20</li>
        <li>Code Check: Nothing breaks when running Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Console is Clear: Console is mostly clear with audio file warnings. However, Score: 8/10</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Final Score: 93/100</p>
    <h2>Requirements Met - Video Demo Link</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Is it useful or entertaining: I would say my project can be interesting, but can get boring quickly Score: 13/15</li>
        <li>Demonstrate Creativity: I would say going with the idea of tower defense it pretty unique, but not hightly creative.     Score: 8/10</li>
        <li>Error-free: I restricted player input for what I expect in the gameplay loop. There are no errors IN GAME Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>Visual Design: The design is basic, but not harsh on the eyes. I did not have the time to include images, which have improved the visual design. Score: 8/10</li>
        <li>Sound: Sounds exists, but doesn't match the atmosphere in my opinion Score: 8/10</li>
        <li>Interface: My interface is simple and easy to understand with everything being labeled. Score: 10/10</li>
        <li>My project is distinct from the example/demo projects Score:
            13/15</li>
        <li>Code I had several usable classes and a money system to buy buildings. Not significant, but well Score: 8/10</li>
        <li>Video Demo: I showed what I made and explained a challenge I overcame. 8/10</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Final Score: 88/100</p>

    <p>Overall, I would say I did a pretty okay job for this project, but there are definitely things I can improve on.</p>

    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <h1>Title Pending</h1>
    <h2>l. High Concept</h2>
    <p>In order to save their kingdom, the player must defend their nation's border from enemy invaders.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>ll. Genre</h2>
    <p>Tower Defense/Real-Time Strategy</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>lll. Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>lV. Story</h2>
    <p>The story is that the player, the general of a nation, must defend the kingdom's border from enemy
        nations
        utilizing different resources at their disposal.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
    <p>The graphics are most likely gonna be pixel art, with sound being 8-bit. I think I will only have sound
        for
        placing buildings and hitting enemies (more info in the next section). I think having sound effects for
        shooting
        may be too much if the player has a lot of buildings, but testing will determine that.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>VI. Mechanics</h2>
    <p> For my mechanics, I intend for the player to be able to purchase different types of buildings to either
        defend
        or produce currency to obtain more buildings/defenses. Powerups or upgrades for buildings would be an
        interesting idea, but would be a stretch goal. There would also be different kinds of enemies the player
        could
        face, which the player must strategize around. There is also the idea of spells the player can cast at
        the cost
        of mana (which I am deeming right now as a stretch goal)
